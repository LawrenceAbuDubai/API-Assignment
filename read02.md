# Investigating APIs

in this page i will be talking about the APIs i used in my app:
location , weather and movies API

What is a Weather API?

A weather API is an Application Programming Interface that allows scripts and code to query weather data. Weather APIs give both historical and forecast weather data through a simple, well-defined programming interface. The greatest APIs include dozens of weather indicators, near-real-time current conditions reporting, and decades of global historical weather data. With the addition of an ultra-long-range forecast based on climatic statistics, both historical and forecast look-ups should be merged into a single API entry point.Anyone building a script, coding an app, or loading a database can use this one entry point to receive quick access to the exact weather data they need from a global database with hundreds of millions of records. Of course, the API's pricing should be low enough that anyone may use it, and new users should be able to get started with their weather project for free.

Why use a weather API

A weather API is appropriate for use cases that require huge amounts of weather data or require automated access to weather data. Using a weather API in your ETL script, for example, is the ideal approach for loading weather data into a corporate data warehouse and comparing it to past sales KPIs. A weather API allows you to access specific weather conditions at any given time and location straight in your code if you're building an app that has to integrate user activity with weather conditions at the time of that action.
A weather API can be utilized from within Excel or Google Sheets to dynamically change your business based on forecast circumstances and how they apply in your individual scenario if you're planning inventory, marketing, and personnel levels at your small business locations.

A weather API's use cases are only limited by your business's needs and imagination. Weather data can be used in a variety of ways, from solar energy generation to shipping to vacation planning. And, because to the power of a weather API, you can quickly automate these operations for your business, organization, or hobby using code or script.

location API
A fused location provider is Location API. The fused location provider is a Google Play Services location API that intelligently integrates various signals to offer the location data that your app requires. It controls the underlying location technologies, such as GPS and Wi-Fi, and provides a simple API for specifying the desired service quality.

When you enable location and Wi-Fi scanning, you can utilize this function to improve the device's location awareness. It calculates the distance between the phone and the RTT-capable Wi-Fi access point (AP).

movie API
Features of the API: Developers can use it to search for all information on films, actors, and characters. This API can also be used to get crucial movie details such as the release date, runtime, genre, directors, authors, actors, and awards.

The API employs HTTP methods and can deliver data in JSON or XML formats.

Ease of Use: Simple, well-documented, and developers may quickly access this documentation.
